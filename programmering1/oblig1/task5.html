	<h1>Task 5</h1>
	<p>% is called the modulo operater, also known as the "remainder" operator. It finds the remainding number after division, wich we can utilize to our favour. For such as in task 4, were I asked if the remaining number is equal to 0. If it wasnt the number would me odd, if it was the number would be even.</p>
	<p>The modulo operator can be used in many different occasions. One of the things it is very good at/often used for resolving large numbers into a consistent result. It can be used to other things too. Like making a large number smaller. Small numbers is very much forgiving to work with versus big numbers.</p>
